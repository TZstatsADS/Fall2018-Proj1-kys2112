# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Data for this project was obtained from the HappyDB GitHub page and processed in the reference files HappyDB_RShiny.Rmd and Text_Processing.Rmd.
