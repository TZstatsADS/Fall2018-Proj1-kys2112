### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Project title: A Generational Comparison of Happiness
+ This project is conducted by Kayla Smith (kys2112).

+ Project summary: During this project I analyzed responses to "What made you happy today?" collected in the HappyDB corpus, with an emphasis on generational differences. I used text mining and sentiment analysis techniques to evaluate responses and explore trends. In particular, I focused on the youngest and oldest cohorts of responders to determine if significant differences were evident between Gen-Z and the Silent Generation. Ultimately I found that, as predicted, Gen-Z and the Silent Generation explore a wide range of topics. In particular, sentiment analysis for the Silent Generation reveals more severe concerns such as death and injury. However, despite being in very different stages of life, the two generations display an interest in family and leisure, demonstrating common themes across the generational spectrum.
